# Hermes

Hermes is an object-following robot based on the Arduino Uno WiFi Rev.2 and the PixyCam v2. It uses color tracking, as well as a panning and tilting camera base,
to follow an object that it is trained on.

This repository contains all of the code for the Arduino. PixyCam code was not edited; I used the default algorithm on the PixyCam.
